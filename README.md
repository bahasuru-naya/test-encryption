![dd](https://github.com/bahasuru-naya/test-encryption/assets/76860751/b3640557-a5c3-4b1f-9d80-58694004445f)

This Java program demonstrates how to perform encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure communication and data protection.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java source code (`\Text\src\TextEncryption.java`).

3. Run the Java file using the following command:
   ```bash
   java TextEncryption.java

or

just run .jar file
